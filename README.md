# compjit

A command line utility designed to accept the output of the UNIX ping command and provide information about the jitter computed from the pings.

## Notes:

(Circa August 2021)  
At the time I was planning to perform a series of tests over a number of network configurations and something I wanted to assess was the jitter. I developed this Python program to help me do that from the terminal, which was my only access point to the devices in question.
